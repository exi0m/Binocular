## San Francisco Housing Investors- Buy to Rent or Buy for Capital Appreciation

What comes to mind when you think about the San Francisco Housing Market?
Expensive, exclusive, scarce?
For us at least, the thought of looking for an apartment in one of the most expensive housing markets in the world was daunting. And we were just looking to rent.
What if you wanted to buy? You’d be entering into a much longer term agreement in just as an expensive market. For first time homebuyers who are brand new to the city, it can be daunting to even pick the right neighborhood, let alone navigate the ins and outs of one of the most important investment decisions you will make. Throw into that the uncertainty of a global pandemic, and you’re pretty much frozen in your tracks.
But it doesn’t have to be that way. Whatever the challenge and uncertainty is, we’re here to help.
We will provide you the tools not only for prospective homeowners, but also for prospective landlords who are looking to enter one of the most fast-paced rental markets in the US.
We aim to do this on three fronts:
1. Making sure the neighborhood you are picking is safe and secure, and the impact that perception has on your future investment’s value
2. Providing you with relevant information and trends based on current events, with our current spotlight being on the coronavirus
3. Helping you evaluate your return on investment
