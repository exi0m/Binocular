##Corona virus and SF housing market notebook

This notebook creates visualizations for the SF rental and housing market along with how the Corona Virus has grown in the city.  Primarly grouped by zip code, the figures, animations and KeplerGL maps help potential investors decide if buying a house for capital appreciation or for rental cash flow is a good investment opportunity.
